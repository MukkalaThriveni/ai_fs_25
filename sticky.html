            In Vedic and Puranic literature, Radha and other forms of the root word Radh have meaning of ‘perfection’, ‘success’ and even ‘wealth’. 
            Lord of Success, Indra was referred to as Radhaspati. In references to Mahavishnu as the Lord of Fortune and freely used by Jayadeva 
            as Jaya Jayadeva Hare – the victorious Hari, and ‘Radhaspati’ all found in many places. The word Radha occurs in the Atharva Veda, 
            Taittiriya Brahmana and Taittiriya Samhita.Charlotte Vaudeville, in the article Evolution of Love Symbolism in Bhagavatism draws some
            parallel to Nappinnai, appearing in Godha's magnum opus Thiruppavai and in Nammalwar's references to Nappinnani, the daughter-in-law 
            of Nandagopa. Nappinnai is believed to be the source of Radha's conception in Prakrit and Sanskrit literature although their characteristic 
            relations with Krishna are different. In the ritual dance called Kuravai, Krishna dances with his wife Nappinnai. "It is a complex relationship, 
            for the devotee is the ‘same as and yet different from’ the Lord, and so even in the joy of union there is the pain of separation. Indeed, the
            highest form of devotion, according to Yamunacarya, comes not in union but after the union, in the ‘fear of new separation’."</p>

                Radha Krishna can be broken into two: Krishna (Devanagari: कृष्ण), the incarnation of Vishnu, which means, "all attractive" or "dark blue",
                and his shakti Radha (Devanagari: राधा), the incarnation of Lakshmi, which means "the pleasing one".Many significant epithets accorded to
                Krishna including - Radha Ramana and Radha Vallabh, which means "the lover and the beloved of Radha" are directly derived from the name
                of his consort, Radha.Similarly, epithets of Radha including - Krishna Kanta, which means "the consort of Krishna" and Krishna Vallabha,
                which means "the eternal companion of Krishna", are directly associated with the name of Krishna.

                Radha Krishna's first literary mention was found in King Hala's Prakrit text Gatha Saptasati which is composed of 700 verses and was written
                in the 1st century CE.Later, the popular Gita Govinda written by Jayadeva in 12th century CE widely depicted Radha and Krishna as a couple.
                According to scriptures like Brahma Vaivarta Purana and Garga Samhita, Radha-Krishna are the supreme deities. Content of both the scriptures
                are majorly basedon the divine pastimes of Radha Krishna in Vrindavan and Goloka. The other relevant texts mentioning Radha Krishna are the 
                Radhopnishad,Radhika Tapani Upanishad,Gopala Tapani Upanishad,Shiva Purana, Brahmanda Purana, Skanda Purana, Padma Purana, Matsya Purana,
                Devi-Bhagavata Purana, Narad Purana, Narada Pancharatra, Radha Tantra, Brahma Samhita and Chaitanya Charitamrita.Radha is also 
                indirectly mentioned in Bhagavata Purana along with Krishna under many different names like "Aradhika" and "Gopi". Adi Shankracharya also
                mentioned Radha under the name of Radhika in his work called "Achyuta Ashtakam" which is dedicated to the Achyuta form of Krishna.
                The devotional works of Jayadeva, Nimbarkacharya, Rasik saints like Chaitanya Mahaprabhu along with his six disciple goswamis, Bhakti 
                poet-saints Narsinh Mehta, Vidyapati, Chandidas, Meera Bai, Surdas and Swami Haridas played pivotal role in spreading devotion to the divine
                couple.According to several Hindu denominations including Gaudiya Vaishnavism, Nimbarka Sampradaya, Pushtimarg, and Swaminarayan Sampradaya,
                it is believed that Radha is not just one cowherd maiden, but the origin of all the Ashtasakhi, Gopis, or divine personalities that participate in the rasa dance.
